Done! Here's how to use it:

  Setup Instructions:

  1. Upload firmware to ESP8266:

  - Build and upload the updated code via PlatformIO

  2. Connect laptop to ESP8266:

  - WiFi Network: GymScroller-MPU6050
  - Password: gymscroller123

  3. Start backend server:

  cd C:\Dev\Gym-Scroller\backend
  python src/main.py

  4. Monitor the stream:

  - ESP8266 will connect to backend at 192.168.4.2:3001
  - Sensor data streams when reps are detected
  - Backend logs: Sensor data from {sid}: {json}
  - Serial monitor shows connection status and data

  What happens:

  - ESP8266 creates WiFi AP and waits for connection
  - When rep detected â†’ sends JSON via WebSocket to backend
  - Backend receives sensorData event and broadcasts to frontend clients
  - Data format: {"rep":1,"duration":2500,"accel":{"x":1.2,"y":0.5,"z":9.8},"gyro":{"x    
  ":0.1,"y":0.2,"z":0.3}}
