## ðŸ”§ If Your Phone Can't Reach the IP:

Make sure:
1. Phone is on **same WiFi** as computer
2. Your computer's firewall allows connections (run PowerShell as Admin):
   ```powershell
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Node.js Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3002
   ```

## ðŸš€ For Production (Share with Others):
Deploy to Vercel (free):
```powershell
cd frontend
npx vercel --prod
```

Then access your app from anywhere with the Vercel URL!
